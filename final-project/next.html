I am a concered citiezen writing from " + lname + " ." + " \n I am writing to respectfully urge you to intervene and stop the execution of Robert Roberson, who is currently scheduled to be executed. Mr. Roberson's case raises significant concerns about the fairness of his trial, the reliability of the evidence used to convict him, and the possibility of a grave miscarriage of justice. Mr. Robersonâ€™s conviction relied heavily on what is now recognized as flawed forensic science, specifically 'shaken baby syndrome' (SBS). In the years since his trial, the medical and scientific community has significantly revised its understanding of SBS, acknowledging that other medical conditions, such as infections or undiagnosed illnesses, can produce similar symptoms. These evolving insights call into question the certainty of Mr. Roberson's guilt. Furthermore, key evidence that could have offered alternative explanations or mitigated his responsibility was not properly considered during the original trial. No individual should face the irreversible punishment of death when doubts remain about the integrity of the process that led to their conviction. I am not asking for Mr. Roberson's crimes to be overlooked. However, in light of the medical advances that cast doubt on the original evidence and the potential for a wrongful execution, I urge you to grant clemency or at least commute his sentence to life in prison. Justice should be served without the risk of killing someone who may be innocent. Texas has long been a leader in balancing justice with fairness, and you have the opportunity to ensure that principle is upheld in this case. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I respectfully hope you will act with compassion and caution in making your decision. \n\n Sincerely, " + fname;
